\beginverse
Such a lonely day 
And it's mine 
The most loneliest day of my life.
\bigskip

Such a lonely day 
Should be banned.
It's a day that I can't stand.
\endverse


\beginchorus
The most loneliest day of my life.
The most loneliest day of my life.
\endchorus


\beginverse
Such a lonely day 
Shouldn't exist.
It's a day that I'll never miss.
\bigskip

Such a lonely day 
And it's mine
The most loneliest day of my life.
\bigskip

And if you go 
I wanna go with you 
And if you die 
I wanna die with you.
\bigskip

Take your hand 
And walk away.
\endverse
